==============

The test.rb is what you needed me to create.
If you want to check how the script works, you only need to execute the following command.

$ ruby test.rb

Then you will get the following result.

"The application is launching"
"======================================================"
"The robert started to move from <1 2 N>"
"Instruction : L => Position : 1 2 W"
"Instruction : M => Position : 0 2 W"
"Instruction : L => Position : 0 2 S"
"Instruction : M => Position : 0 1 S"
"Instruction : L => Position : 0 1 E"
"Instruction : M => Position : 1 1 E"
"Instruction : L => Position : 1 1 N"
"Instruction : M => Position : 1 2 N"
"Instruction : M => Position : 1 3 N"
"Instruction : \n => Position : 1 3 N"
"Destination is : <1 3 N>"
"======================================================"
"The robert started to move from <3 3 E>"
"Instruction : M => Position : 4 3 E"
"Instruction : M => Position : 5 3 E"
"Instruction : R => Position : 5 3 S"
"Instruction : M => Position : 5 2 S"
"Instruction : M => Position : 5 1 S"
"Instruction : R => Position : 5 1 W"
"Instruction : M => Position : 4 1 W"
"Instruction : R => Position : 4 1 N"
"Instruction : R => Position : 4 1 E"
"Instruction : M => Position : 5 1 E"
"Destination is : <5 1 E>"
"Thank you!"

Thanks for your attention.
